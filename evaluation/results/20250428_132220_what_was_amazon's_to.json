    "explanation": "The actual answer is factually accurate, as it correctly states Amazon's total revenue for 2023 and the percentage increase from the previous year, matching the expected answer. It also provides additional detailed information about revenue by segment, which is accurate and enhances the completeness of the response. The relevance score is slightly lower because the additional segment information, while informative, is not directly necessary to answer the question about total revenue."
